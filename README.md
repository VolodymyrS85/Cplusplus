# Cplusplus

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program takes in a word document, counts the frequency of the given item or all the items and outputs information about it.
# What did you do particularly well?
I used a fstream class to read the provided document and to write a backup file to the document “frequency.dat”.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could've created separate header files insted of creating just one cpp file.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
When I was checking if the item is already in my list (vector), I had to use .begin() and .end() vector functions which I've never used before. I had to search online to accomplish this task.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Reading from files and writing to files will be particularly transferable.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I applied industry standard best practices such as in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to enhance readability and maintainability.
